Vite: Stabilize the Remix Vite plugin, Cloudflare preset, and all related types by removing all `unstable_` / `Unstable_` prefixes.

While this is a breaking change for existing Remix Vite plugin consumers, now that the plugin has stabilized, there will no longer be any breaking changes outside of a major release. Thank you to all of our early adopters and community contributors for helping us get here! 🙏
